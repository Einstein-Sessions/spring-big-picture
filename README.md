* Although these were great projects, creating an application in Spring was very difficult.
* This is when _Spring Boot_ came in as it made it easy to create Spring base applications quickly and easily.
* After Spring Boot, came _Spring Cloud_ which was built on top of _Spring Boot_ and was created to simplify and use cloud
patterns in building Spring Application using pattern such as _Service Discovery_ and _Distributed Configuration_.
* The _Spring Cloud_ project was mainly aimed at Distributed Applications e.g. Microservice Applications.

## Why Spring?

* Creating software is hard but _Spring_ makes it easier to create _Java Enterprise Applications_.
* Backwards compatible.
* Large and active community.
* Continually innovates and evolves.

## Spring Boot Makes Spring Both Quick and Easy

* Learning any new technology can be hard, confusing and frustrating.
* Thankfully Spring Boot makes learning _Spring_ both quick and easy.
* Don't confuse _Easy_ with _Lack of Features_. Spring Boot is fully featured and used on a 
ton of systems in production today.

## Understanding Spring Boot's Key Features

### Auto-Configuration

* Spring Boot will automatically configure and setup an application based on its surrounding
as well as hints provided by the developer.

### Standalone

* You don't need to deploy your application to a web-server or anything of that sort to get
to run. You literally just run the application with just one command just like you would 
with any other application.

### Opinionated

* Spring Boot has a chosen way of doing things by default.
