* Although these were great projects, creating an application in Spring was very difficult.
* This is when _Spring Boot_ came in as it made it easy to create Spring base applications quickly and easily.
* After Spring Boot, came _Spring Cloud_ which was built on top of _Spring Boot_ and was created to simplify and use cloud
patterns in building Spring Application using pattern such as _Service Discovery_ and _Distributed Configuration_.
* The _Spring Cloud_ project was mainly aimed at Distributed Applications e.g. Microservice Applications.

## Why Spring?

* Creating software is hard but _Spring_ makes it easier to create _Java Enterprise Applications_.
* Backwards compatible.
* Large and active community.
* Continually innovates and evolves.
